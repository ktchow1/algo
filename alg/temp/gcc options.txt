-g1 = minimal debug info
-g2 = average debug info (typical option)
-g3 = detailed debug info

-O0 = no optimization
-O2 =    optimization in performance, try to balance compilation time (typical option)
-O3 = maximum optimization

-O2 includes :
* loop unrolling
* function inlining
* dead code elimination (code without effect or never executed)
* common subexpression elimination (eliminate redundant calculation)
* instruction reordering
* branch prediction optimization
